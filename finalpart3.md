#### Final Data Story  
The intended audience for my story is people who know a little bit about climate change but do not know how they are personally contributing. These individuals are aware of some “green” efforts such as reusable shopping bags but are not aware of food’s connection to climate change. My audience is United States based and are either Millennials or Generation X. With my story, I want to engage people who are interested in reducing their environmental impact but don’t know where to start; and, I want to convince the meat eater who makes fun of vegans to try a Meatless Monday or consider a chicken sandwich instead of a burger next time he is at the grill.  

This story was completed to showcase the data visualization and story telling concepts I learned in class. The end result utilizes my new knowledge of color concepts, different chart types, new data visualization tools/software, and the importance of user feedback.  

My story started out as an idea to show the carbon footprint of food. From there, I researched different data sources that could be used to tell this story – greenhouse gas emissions of countries, economic sectors, and food; protein content of food; and dietary guidelines. Armed with this data I framed out my story’s message, funneling the audience from a broad picture view of climate change to their own dietary impact. Next, I created wireframes which provided a rough view of my story’s charts and message. The user feedback from people who fit my target audience and my classmates was extremely helpful. I used their feedback and reactions to amend the areas of my story that were confusing, unintentionally misleading, or left more to be desired (see the link to Part II for more detail). I used Datawrapper and Tableau to create my visualizations, then built my story in Shorthand. I closed my story with a call to action which encouraged people to reduce the amount of meat in their diets, and I provided a few simple tips and a resource of recipes to get them started.

Because I know my story will not stay live on Shorthand forever, but, alas, the internet lives forever, below are screenshots from the final display.
