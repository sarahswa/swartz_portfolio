A portfolio of my work from Carnegie Mellon University's Telling Stories with Data class

## About Me
Hi, my name is Sarah Swartz, and I am a positive, driven individual who aims to lead companies and organizations toward a low-carbon economy and a more sustainable future. I work in corporate sustainability for a financial services firm in the Pittsburgh area. In this role, I track, manage, and report on the companyâ€™s environmental resource use. This involves energy and greenhouse gas emissions, waste, water, and paper. I also manage our environmental employee engagement group called the Sustainability Ambassadors.  

I am also working towards a Master of Public Management at Carnegie Mellon University. I am currently in my second year of this program and plan to graduate in the spring of 2021. It is exciting to apply the management, data analytic, and policy skills I am learning to my current role.  

In my free time, I enjoy playing volleyball and cooking.  I love being creative in the kitchen and tasting the end result.

## What I Hope to Learn
As part of this Telling Stories with Data class, I hope to learn effective ways to communicate findings within data. In the environmental sustainability field, it is important to measure and report on a company's environmental footprint for voluntary and mandatory reporting  frameworks. For example, greenhouse gas emissions and how climate change will affect a company are complicated topics. While I am confident that I can explain these topics in an understandable way, using data to communicate this message would enhance my ability to drive action for a more sustainable future.  

I hope to use the skills I learn in this class to better communicate the story of my company's environmental progress to my colleagues, senior managers, external rankers, and other community stakeholders.
